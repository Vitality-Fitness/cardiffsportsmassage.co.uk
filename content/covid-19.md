description: Statement about the ongoing COVID-19 / Coronavirus condition

It's been a long wait for you all through these uncertain times and with frequently changing governement advice it has been difficult for me and for you, where many of you are in discomfort or pain. I am very much hoping that from July 27th I will be able to begin work again. I will open up the booking system within the next week so that you can schedule an appointment. As ever, this date is subject to change depending on new information regarding the virus, but I am happy to be able to, at last, give my clients a date my clinic will hopefully reopen. This date has come from government guidelines on 10th July 2020 and also welcomes acupunturists to begin work again. You will, of course, see many changes in the clinic to help keep us all safe including; me wearing PPE, risk assessment for each client, no towels used so all surfaces can be fully wiped down between clients, no waiting room etc. The full details will be available shortly. If you are an exisitng client then you may have been added to my waiting list, I will prioritise booking people in from the waiting list first. I hope this makes sense. 

Thank you for your custom.  Stay well, and I look forward to seeing you soon 

Donna
