It's been a long wait for you all through these uncertain times and with frequently changing governement advice it has been difficult for me and for you, where many of you are in discomfort or pain. Today I am able to give you some useful news; I am very much hoping that from 27th July 2020 I will be able to reopen my clinic! I will open up the online booking system within the next week so that you can schedule an appointment. As ever, this date is subject to change depending on new information regarding the virus, but I am happy to be able to, at last, give my clients a date my clinic will hopefully reopen. This date has come from the new government guidelines announced on the 10th July 2020 and also welcomes acupunturists to begin work again. You will, of course, see many changes in the clinic to help keep us all safe, including:

* Once your appointment is made you must fill out an online screening form. If the form is not complete 24 hours before the appointment time your appointment will be cancelled. 

* Please remember that certain health conditions make you more vulnerable to getting COVID-19. You can check out the details here:https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/whos-at-higher-risk-from-coronavirus/

* Upon arrival at the clinic, please stay in your car. There is no longer a waiting room. I shall contact you when I am ready and meet you at the entrance to the clinic.

* You will need to wear a mask on entering the clinic and it will have to remain in place until you leave the clinic.You will be asked to sanitise your hands on entering the clinic.

* There will be a contactless bluetooth thermometer that I will use to take your temperature at the entrance of the clinic. If your temperature is high then you must leave immediately and follow government guidance.

* Bring your own water bottle and leave it in the car so you can rehydrate after the treatment. Leave unnecessary belongings at home or in the car.

* I shall be wearing a mask and visor.Where possible, in communal areas we should adhere to the 2m distancing rule.

* The couch will not have towels on. I will be using paper couch and paper face hole coverings instead.I

* I have scheduled in 15 minutes between clients to allow time to air, sanitise rooms and collect/escort clients out.

* If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19 before your appointment (fever, cough, loss of sense of smell/taste) please cancel your appointment. 

* If you have been in contact with someone with symptoms of COVID-19 or with a positive test you must self isolate for 14 days.

* If you experience any symptoms after your appointment (up to 7 days) you must inform me so that I can inform the clinic manager. 

* You must come to the appointment alone where possible and if you have someone with you they must wait in the car after escorting you to the entrance.

* The toilet is of very high risk and so therefore should not be used if at all possible.All persons to try to avoid touching surfaces where possible. 

I hope this is all clear and will allow us to come back to work/treatments in a safe way for everyone. 

I look forward to seeing you all soon.


Thank you for your custom.  Stay well, and I look forward to seeing you soon 

Donna
