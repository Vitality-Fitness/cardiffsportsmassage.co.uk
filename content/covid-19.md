Welsh government guidance is now permitting face to face treatments in the clinic which I classify as urgent. A video or phone consultation will be completed first and, if you're condition is deemed urgent, the treatment in clinic will be a short as possible. You can book in <a href="https://vitfitcdf.as.me/" role="button">here</a> and then I shall call you at a convenient time to conduct the consultation. This means face to face contact will be kept to a minimum in line with government guidelines.    

Thanks to everyone for your support through this difficult time. Of course, if you have any questions please email or call me. 

<!-- Thank you for following the procedures in and around the clinic as it helps to keep everyone safe by minimising risk of spread of COVID-19. 

When we are open you will, of course, see many changes in the clinic to help keep us all safe, including:

* Once your appointment is made you must fill out an online screening form. If the form is not complete 24 hours before the appointment time your appointment will be cancelled. 

* Please remember that certain health conditions make you more vulnerable to getting COVID-19. You can check out the details here:https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/whos-at-higher-risk-from-coronavirus/

* Upon arrival at the clinic, please stay in your car. There is no longer a waiting room. I shall contact you when I am ready and meet you at the entrance to the clinic.

* You will need to wear a mask on entering the clinic and it will have to remain in place until you leave the clinic.You will be asked to sanitise your hands on entering the clinic.

* There will be a contactless bluetooth thermometer that I will use to take your temperature at the entrance of the clinic. If your temperature is high then you must leave immediately and follow government guidance.

* Bring your own water bottle and leave it in the car so you can rehydrate after the treatment. Leave unnecessary belongings at home or in the car.

* I shall be wearing a mask. Where possible, in communal areas we should adhere to the 2m distancing rule.

* The couch will not have towels on. I will be using paper couch and paper face hole coverings instead.

* I have scheduled in 15 minutes between clients to allow time to air, sanitise rooms and collect/escort clients in/out.

* If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19 before your appointment (fever, cough, loss of sense of smell/taste) please cancel your appointment. 

* If you have been in contact with someone with symptoms of COVID-19 or with a positive test you must self isolate for 14 days.

* If you experience any symptoms after your appointment (up to 7 days) you must inform me so that I can inform the clinic manager. 

* You must come to the appointment alone where possible and if you have someone with you they must wait in the car after escorting you to the entrance.

* The toilet is of very high risk and so therefore should not be used if at all possible.

* All persons to try to avoid touching surfaces where possible. 

I hope this is all clear and reassures you that we are doing everything possible to keep everyone safe. -->

Thank you for your custom and patience. I look forward to seeing you all soon.
