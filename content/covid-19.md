Due to the lockdown announced last month and the clinic being closed since, I am started to branch out via different pathways with the aim to be able to still help you even if a clinic appointment isn't possible. As of 1st February I will be opening up bookings for online treatments via video. While this will be a different approach it has helped and is helping people right now. I'd like to adopt this approach as it is the safest way we can help at the moment. These will be done via, Zoom or WhatsApp depending on your preference.

Online assessment and treatment will include:

* Full assessment just as we would in clinic 
* Any muscoskeletal tests, if applicable, to help me define the problem with full instruction & demonstration from myself.
* Explanation of my thoughts and diagnosis from consultation and tests.
* Demonstratation from me for any exercises (stretching/strengthening/self massage) as applicable.
* You demonstrate the same exercises or self massage with close guidance and feedback from myself.
* Explanation of what I think should happen in the future regarding exercises, frequency and duration.
* Accountability, I'll suggest when you should rebook another video appointment for follow-up and ensure you get the most out of the sessions.

Thanks to everyone for your support through this difficult time. Of course, if you have any questions please email or call me. 

<!-- Thank you for following the procedures in and around the clinic as it helps to keep everyone safe by minimising risk of spread of COVID-19. 

When we are open you will, of course, see many changes in the clinic to help keep us all safe, including:

* Once your appointment is made you must fill out an online screening form. If the form is not complete 24 hours before the appointment time your appointment will be cancelled. 

* Please remember that certain health conditions make you more vulnerable to getting COVID-19. You can check out the details here:https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/whos-at-higher-risk-from-coronavirus/

* Upon arrival at the clinic, please stay in your car. There is no longer a waiting room. I shall contact you when I am ready and meet you at the entrance to the clinic.

* You will need to wear a mask on entering the clinic and it will have to remain in place until you leave the clinic.You will be asked to sanitise your hands on entering the clinic.

* There will be a contactless bluetooth thermometer that I will use to take your temperature at the entrance of the clinic. If your temperature is high then you must leave immediately and follow government guidance.

* Bring your own water bottle and leave it in the car so you can rehydrate after the treatment. Leave unnecessary belongings at home or in the car.

* I shall be wearing a mask. Where possible, in communal areas we should adhere to the 2m distancing rule.

* The couch will not have towels on. I will be using paper couch and paper face hole coverings instead.

* I have scheduled in 15 minutes between clients to allow time to air, sanitise rooms and collect/escort clients in/out.

* If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19 before your appointment (fever, cough, loss of sense of smell/taste) please cancel your appointment. 

* If you have been in contact with someone with symptoms of COVID-19 or with a positive test you must self isolate for 14 days.

* If you experience any symptoms after your appointment (up to 7 days) you must inform me so that I can inform the clinic manager. 

* You must come to the appointment alone where possible and if you have someone with you they must wait in the car after escorting you to the entrance.

* The toilet is of very high risk and so therefore should not be used if at all possible.

* All persons to try to avoid touching surfaces where possible. 

I hope this is all clear and reassures you that we are doing everything possible to keep everyone safe. -->

Thank you for your custom and patience. I look forward to seeing you all soon.
