I am keeping my approach to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) situation under close review due to frequently changing advice. My decisions are based on the importance of safeguarding the health and wellbeing of treatment providers and clients coming to the clinic who are my top priority.  With that in mind, as of March 21 2020, **I am no longer accepting bookings** for sports massage until further notice.

Thank you for your custom.  Stay well, and I look forward to seeing you after these uncertain times. 

Donna
