description: Statement about the ongoing COVID-19 / Coronavirus condition

I am keeping my approach to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) situation under close review due to frequently changing advice. My decisions are based on the importance of safeguarding the health and wellbeing of treatment providers and clients coming to the clinic who are my top priority.

If you come to clinic there are some basic things we can do to help ourselves and others:

- Wash your hands upon arrival at the clinic
- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze. Put any used tissues in the bins after use and wash your hands immediately. If soap & water aren't available use s hand sanitiser.
- If you have returned from any of the [specified areas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-specified-countries-and-areas/covid-19-specified-countries-and-areas-with-implications-for-returning-travellers-or-visitors-arriving-in-the-uk) on the UK government website in the last 14 days do not come to the clinic.
- Don't come if you have any symptoms of any virus, or if you have been required to self-isolate.
- Wash your hands when you return home.

As a further preventative measure I will be using more couch roll to cover the whole couch and will continue to clean down the face hole of the couch after each treatment. Door handles & hard surfaces in the clinic will be cleaned after each client.

## Cancellation Policy

If you have booked in and then experience symptoms within 48 hrs of your appointment please contact me and I will reschedule your appointment or provide a credit note at no charge.

Thank you for reading and if I don't see you during I will look forward to seeing you after these uncertain times. 

Please look after yourselves and your communities and stay well.
