<p class="mb-0">Wanted a sports massage prior to a triathlon race. The online booking system was very simple and clear, with availability in the evening which is really convenient. Donna was clearly very knowledgeable and made sure to tailor the session to my specific needs. One of the best sports massages I've had (had quite a few!) Highly recommended.</p>

<p class="mb-0">I found the experience very beneficial and will be making it a regular event to keep my old bones moving!</p>
<p class="mb-0">The website is clear and concise and being able to book online makes the whole experience straightforward. I have pencilled in my diary to visit again in 2/3 weeks time.</p>
<p class="mb-0">I found [Donna] very knowledgeable and professional and will be recommending [her] to the guys I train with who are constantly moaning about various aches and pains.</p>

<p class="mb-0">You will be in good hands, literally, with Donna - she is friendly. easy to converse with and as the consultation and treatment progress you realise that she really knows what she's doing. I visited Donna with a three-month old shoulder injury and the deep tissue massage received was very good. The stronger the pressure the better as far as I'm concerned and Donna can certainly deliver that but be assured she won't go too far and her easy 'bedside' manner is very relaxing. Donna finished up with some useful exercise suggestions which I am following. You don't have to be the sporty type (I'm certainly not!) - if you have a problem that massage therapy might help then this is the place for you. Vitality Sports Massage is now in my phone contacts and my email address book and I would recommend Donna without hesitation to family and friends.</p>

<p class="mb-0">As a seasoned triathlete, sports massage is an integral part of my training plan. I have been visiting Vitality Fitness for a number of months and will keep returning. Donna is super - very friendly and highly skilled at what she does. I always come away feeling rejuvenated and tense free, ready to hit another big block of training. Location is easy to find. Highly recommend!</p>

<p>I couldn't recommend Donna more highly. She has a great understanding of the body and it's tough demands and offers a really deep sports massage which I love!</p>

<p>Professional, very knowledgable and effect service. Highly recommend. After suffering for a few months, 30 minute deep sports massage and my shoulder now feels great. Thank you.</p>

<p>Came in with pain in my shoulder and have left with more movement than I have had in years. Will most definitely be back!! Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Well I came back and am so glad I did.... I won't say it did not hurt... that is obvious... but I now have much more movement in my neck and shoulders.... back soon for the lower back :)</p>

<p>I first came to see Donna a few weeks ago with a severe recurring muscle pain in my neck/upper back. I'd never had sports massage before but Donna was fantastic - she made me feel very listened to, and and the treatment made a world of difference. Every session I left feeling 100x better than when I arrived, and I'm now pain-free, with lots of advice and stretches etc to do to make sure it stays that way. I'm really glad I found Vitality Fitness!</p>

<p>I emailed Donna on a Sunday night and got a reply back on the same night. On my first visit explained my problem with my hamstring and glutes, Donna immediately helped to resolve my problem. I'm VERY happy with the service I have received and would highly recommend to anyone.</p>

<p>This was my first proper sports massage, and Donna was great.  The massage was very effective and released a lot of tension I'd built up in my legs.  We chatted away the whole time (sorry Donna!).  Will definitely come again.</p>

<p>After a prolonged break from exercise I have decided to get fit once again.  Of course doing so is not without its drawbacks.  I have been suffering with heavy, tight legs and bouts of cramp.  I saw Donna who instantly put my mind at rest.  She listened intently to my symptoms and provided a deep, though not painful, massage - a rarity with sports massage!  I would highly recommend Donna to anyone requiring assistance with a troublesome body.</p>

<p>I received a great massage from Donna, After quick assessment she got to work on my legs (complete mess after 2 ACL reconstructions). I've had a fair amount of sports massage in the last 6 years and Donna is up there with the best I've had. My calfs were in much better shape the next day and hamstrings were although sore which is to be expected, much better than they have been for months. Looking forward to my next massage (if you can look forward to sports massage)</p>

<p>I am going back for my third session next week and planning on regular sessions to keep my 'work related back problem' at bay.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I've had knee problems several times over the last few years and being an elite cyclist I'm keen to sort these problems out as quickly as possible! Donna has helped me hugely in both finding and solving the problems I've had to get me back on the bike as swiftly as possible. Thanks!</p>

<p>Donna gave an excellent healing massage and I'm looking forward to returning for future treatments to keep me in working order in the run-up to the half marathon I've entered.  I had a slight injury to my hamstring and felt disappointed that it was affecting my training but after one session I'm back jogging again.  Thank you Donna.</p>
